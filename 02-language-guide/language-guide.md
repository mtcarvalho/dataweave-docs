# Dataweave Language Guide Notes

- DataWeave is a functional language used in Mule applications to perform data transformations.

## DW Script

header and body, separated by three dashes ( `---`)
- header: contains language directives, including 
	- the output format of the transformation
	- variables and function declarations
	- [importing](#import-function-modules) of prebuilt DW modules with functions available to use in scripts
- body: contains the expression to generate a result (data mapping or transformation)
  example:
```
%dw 2.0   
output application/json   
---   
payload  
```
	
## Data Types

- simple (e.g., String, Boolean, Number)
- composite and complex (e.g., Array, Object and Any)

## Data Selectors

enable to access fields within a data structure so you can retrieve data from payload or variables

- Single-value selector: e.g., `payload.userName` retrieve the single value `userName`, which is a key of `payload`

## Functions


- **every function returns a value** after it finishes processing, and this value can then be used as input for a different function. in DW, functions aren't imperative statements that change program states.
- each DW script that you write in **any** component works as an **independent** program, meaning that all function definitions and calls are unique to the script defined in the component.
-  function definition vs. function call
	- in DW, you **define** functions in the header of the script, creating a blueprint for the process that defines the operations that are executed upon the function call.
	- when you **call** a function from a DW expression, you are instructing DW to run all the operations defined in that function at that exact point of the scriptâ€™s execution.
	- DW supports both **prefix** notation `(function (param1, param2))` and **infix** notation `(param1 function param2)` for function calls. Note that you can use infix notation **only** with functions that accept only two parameters.
	
## Data Operators:

- mathematical: `+, -, /, *`
- relational: `<, >, <=, >=, ==, ~=`
- logical: `not, !, and, or`
- append `(<<, +)`, prepend `(>>)`, and remove `(-)`, which enable you to manage data in an array.
- scope and flow control operators `(do, using, if, else)` that enable you to create a scope where new variables and functions can be declared, or to execute an expression based on a condition.
- update `(update)`, which enables you to update specific fields of a data structure.

## Import Function Modules

- by default, DW scripts import the `dw::Core` function module. 
- to use functions from different modules, import the modules to your script by adding the `import` directive.
	
## Arrays

- to declare an array, use brackets `([ and ])` to enclose a comma-separated list of elements, for example: `[1,2,3]`.
- arrays also support the application of conditional logic to define conditional elements (`[(value1) if condition]`).
  example:
```
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
[(1) if true, (2) if false, (3) if payload != null]
``` 

## DW and Functional Programming

- DW enables you to take advantage of the benefits of functional programming: pure functions, immutable variables and data, function signatures, concise and clear code, call-by-need strategy (lazy evaluation), first-class functions, high-order functions, function composition and lambda expressions
  - example of function composition:
  in this case, the result of executing one function ( `pluck`) serves as an input parameter for the next function ( `filter`).
```
%dw 2.0
output application/json
var collaborators =
{
	Max: {role: "admin", id: "01"},
	Einstein: {role: "dev", id: "02"},
	Astro: {role: "admin", id: "03"},
	Blaze: {role: "user", id: "04"}
}
---
collaborators pluck ((value,key,index)->  {
		"Name": key,
		"Role": upper(value.role),
		"ID": value.id
	})
	filter ((item, index) -> item.Role == "ADMIN")
```

  - example of function composition with prefix notation (explained better on [functions](#functions) section)
```
%dw 2.0
output application/json
var collaborators =
{
    Max: {role: "admin", id: "01"},
    Einstein: {role: "dev", id: "02"},
    Astro: {role: "admin", id: "03"},
    Blaze: {role: "user", id: "04"}
}
---
filter(
   pluck(
       collaborators, (value,key,index)->
       {
           "Name": key,
           "Role": upper(value.role),
           "ID": value.id
       }),
   (item, index) -> item.Role == "ADMIN")
```

  - example of lambda expression:
```
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
["Max", "the", "Mule"] map (item, index) -> index ++ " - " ++ item
```

### Differences with Imperative Programming

- functional programming separates data from functions: each function works only with the data you provide as input. if you need to modify any existing data structure, you **create a new copy** and **apply functions to modify its values**.
- functional programming does not use loop control statements. there are no loop control statements like `for` or `while` in DW. however, you can use `if-else` statements to apply a condition when executing an expression:

```
%dw 2.0
var myVar = { country : "FRANCE" }
output application/json
---
if (myVar.country == "USA")
  { currency: "USD" }
else { currency: "EUR" }
```
